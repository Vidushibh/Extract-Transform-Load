Four tables used: Users, User devices, User transaction history and Consumer loan complaints.

Each of these tables is explained below briefly:

Users: This table includes rows of users and various columns that describe each user's demographics and banking information. This is the largest table that GCNB provided in terms of the sheer volume of data.

User devices: This table tracks what kind of device each user primarily uses when banking electronically with GCNB.

User transaction history: This table includes records of individual financial transactions and the monetary value of each transaction.

Consumer loan complaints: This table includes information about complaints that users have sent to GCNB when going through the loan process.
